Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, 
coding is done for  that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

 Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, JavaScript coding is done so that user can set multiple filters 
 and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
  
 * Using a date form in your HTML document and writing JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
 * In javascript code, I have selected the unique values from each selection criteria and loaded them in drop down menu for selection purposes using d3 library.
